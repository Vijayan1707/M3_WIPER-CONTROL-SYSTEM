# WIPER-CONTROL-SYSTEM

## Abstract

  Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen.The wipers are now available in the front and back window  shields the of cars and many other automobiles.A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached.The blade is swung back and forth across the glass, removing any water, any precipitation, or other obstructions to view.Nowadays the wiper speed is changeable and also we can give some delay for swung the blade so that it will automatically swung after a period of time.In this project i explain about the wiper control system by using the led,STM32F047VG.

### COMPONENTS REQUIRED
 
 * STM32F407VG

### PROCEDURE

* For the ignition of key position the Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs
* On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz
* The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2
* The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs

### CONCLUSION

 * Wiper system is control is successfully implemented by using STM32F047VG.
 
### REFERENCE

 * Referred push button to control the LED's of STM32.
 * Surefed in internet regarding CODING.
