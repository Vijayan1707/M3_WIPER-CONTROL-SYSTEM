# STEPPER-MOTOR-CONTROL

## ABSTRACT

 * Stepper motor is a brushless DC motor that divides the full rotation angle of 360° into a number of equal steps.
 * The motor is rotated by applying a certain sequence of control signals. The speed of rotation can be changed by changing the rate at which the control signals are applied.
 * Various stepper motors with different step angles and torque ratings are available in the market.
 * A microcontroller can be used to apply different control signals to the motor to make it rotate according to the need of the application.

### COMPONENTS
 
 * ATMEGA328
 * ULN2803 DRIVER
 * STEPPER MOTOR
 * SIMULIDE
 * CODEBLOCKS

### PROCEDURE

 * Here we are going to interface 6 wires Unipolar Stepper Motor with ATmega32 controller.
 * Only four wires are required to control the stepper motor. 
 * Two common wires of stepper motor connected to 5V supply.
 * ULN2803 driver is used to the driving stepper motor.
 * ATmega32 to rotate the stepper motor 360° clockwise by half step sequence and 360° anticlockwise by full step sequence.

### Testing and Coding

 * Preferable Coding Software for Avr Coding is Microchip studio.
 * You have to use C compiler with MINGGW(latest or the previous versions).
 * Set path for MINGGW in Environment variables.
 * To go with best compiler use CODE BLOCKS.
 * In CODE BLOCKS you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.

### CONCLUSION

 * Stepper Motor is controlled by using Atmega328 microcontroller.
 
### REFERENCE

 * Referred Stepper motor control with Atmega328 MCU.
 * Surefed in internet regarding AVR CODING.
