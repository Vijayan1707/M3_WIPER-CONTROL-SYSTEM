# M3_WIPER-CONTROL-SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT

  Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen.The wipers are now available in the front and back window shields the of cars and many other automobiles.A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached.The blade is swung back and forth across the glass, removing any water, any precipitation, or other obstructions to view.Nowadays the wiper speed is changeable and also we can give some delay for swung the blade so that it will automatically swung after a period of time.In this project i explain about the wiper control system by using the LED,STM32F407VG.
